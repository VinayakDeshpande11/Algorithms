# Arrays

 > Array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by array index. 
 >
 > An array is stored such tha the position of each element can  be computed from its index cell by a mathematical formula.

## Properties of Array:
    1. Array can store data of specified data type.
    2. It has contiguous memory location.
    3. Every*cell*of an Array has a unique*Index*.
    4. *Index*starts with 0.
    5. Size of an Array needs to be specified mandatority and cannot be modified.

NB: This array is different from the Swift's Standard Library. The array size cannot be modified once declared. Though we will be using Array of Standard library for implementation and will use the Standard Library APIs.
